# stock-count

The stock count of Selin's warehouse: every product, with its number.

## The count
- The count lives in `count.txt`.
- One product per line: a name, one space, a number.
- New products go at the end of the file.

## How to change it
1. Open an issue.
2. Make a branch.
3. Commit, push, and open a pull request.
4. Somebody else reviews it before it is merged.

The same steps as a diagram: [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md).

## Read the history
Every line of the count has a commit behind it:
```
git log --oneline count.txt
git blame count.txt
```

## Decisions
- [0001 - The count is a plain text file](docs/adr/0001-plain-text-count.md)
